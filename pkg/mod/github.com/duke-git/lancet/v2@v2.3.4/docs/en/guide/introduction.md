# What is lancet?

<b>Lancet is a powerful, efficient, and reusable util function library of go. Inspired by the java apache common package and lodash.js. </b>


## Why lancet?

Lancet makes Go dev easier by taking the hassle out of working with concurrency, net, math, slice, string, etc.
Lancet's utility methods are great for:

- Iterating slice and  array.
- Manipulating strings.
- Work with net and http.
- Other tools, eg. random, crypto, stream, retry, etc.
